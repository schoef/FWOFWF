It is required that the participants of the project meet in order to discuss
progress, analyse problems and carry out the tasks detailed in the work plan.
Moreover, it is necessary that the participants travel to CERN during critical periods,
typically when the analysis is at the collaborations approval stage 
in the publication procedure.

Ticket costs for return flight VIE-GVA-VIE, VIE-CRL-VIE and CRL-GVA-CRL each are approx. EUR 350.
Room rates in Vienna and Ghent are approx. EUR 80/night, while
the CERN Hostel charges approx. EUR 60/night.

Therefore, a one-week trip to CERN (5 nights) from either Ghent or Vienna amounts to approx. EUR 650 and a one-week trip (5 nights) to Vienna (from Ghent) or to Ghent (from Vienna) amounts to EUR 750.

We forsee the annual need for the following travels: 
1) D. Dobur and L. Shchutska will each travel from Ghent to CERN three times, totalling to approx. EUR 3900. 
2) D. Dobur and  L. Shchutska will each travel from Ghent to Vienna four times, totalling to approx. EUR 6000. 
3) R. Schoefbeck and the Ph.D. student will each travel from Vienna to Ghent two times, totalling to approx. EUR 3000.
4) The Ph.D. student will travel from Vienna to CERN four times, totalling approx. 2600.
Travel expenses for R. Schoefbeck to go to CERN are covered by the HEPHY.
In total, the annual travel expenses amount to approx. EUR 9900 for D. Dobur and L. Shchutska (UGent) and to approx. EUR 5600 for R. Schoefbeck and the Ph.D. student (Vienna).
